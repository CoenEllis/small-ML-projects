# XOR Neural Network

A PyTorch implementation of a simple feedforward neural network that learns the XOR logic function.

## Overview
This project demonstrates how a basic NN can learn XOR.

## Features
- **Simple Architecture** - 2-input -> hidden layer -> 1 output with sigmoid activation
- **GPU Support** - Automatically uses CUDA if available
- **Checkpointing** - Save and load model states during training
- **Progress Tracking** - Configurable loss reporting intervals
- **Training Visualization** - Displays predictions after training
