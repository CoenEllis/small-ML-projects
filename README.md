# Small Machine Learning Projects

A collection of small machine learning projects built in Python to understand
ML concepts.

## Overview
This repository focuses on machine learning models at a small scale, demonstrating ML
workflows and frameworks.

## Projects
- **NumPy XOR** - Neural network using only NumPy to learn the XOR logic function
- **XOR** - PyTorch neural network that learns the XOR logic function
- **Linear Regression** - PyTorch linear regression model that identifies age of plant
- **Logistic Regression** - PyTorch logistic regression model that classifies a plant based on characteristics
- **MLP Classifier** - PyTorch MLP that trains on the same data as the logistic regression model but with a hidden layer.
- **Evaluation Metrics** - A program to train a model and display accuract and a confusion matrix to understand error.

## Purpose
These projects show understanding of how machine learning models work, and also projects demonstrating them.
