# Small Machine Learning Projects

A collection of small machine learning projects built in Python to understand
ML concepts.

## Overview
This repository focuses on machine learning models at a small scale, demonstrating ML
workflows and frameworks.

## Projects
- **NumPy XOR** - Neural network using only NumPy

## Purpose
These projects show understanding of how machine learning models work, and also projects demonstrating them.
